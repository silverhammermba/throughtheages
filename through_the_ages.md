# Cheat Sheet for Through the Ages #

Rules marked (SIMPLE) or (FULL) are only for the simple or full game,
respectively. Generally the full game does not remove rules from the advanced
game, so rules marked (ADVANCED) are for _both_ the advanced and full game.
Rules marked (ADVANCED only) do not apply to the full game.

Throughout the game, remember to look for adjustments to your civilization's
culture and science rating after every action.

## Set Up ##

### Remove Cards ###

(SIMPLE) Remove **Development of Politics** from _Military Deck A_. Set aside
_Civil Decks II_ and _III_ and _Military Decks I, II_, and _III_.

(ADVANCED only) Remove the 4 **War** cards from _Military Deck II_. Randomly
select 4 **Event** cards from _Military Deck III_ and place them near the board.
Set aside the rest of _Military Deck III_ and _Civil Deck III_.

(ADVANCED) Randomly select 2+(# players) cards from _Military Deck A_ and set
aside the rest. For a 2 player game, remove the **Pact** cards from the
_Military Decks_.

Remove any cards from the _Civil Decks_ that do not match the number of players
(3+, 4+).

### Set up the board ###

1. Shuffle _Military Deck A_ and place it on _CURRENT EVENTS_
2. Shuffle _Civil Deck A_ and fill the card row with them, placing the rest on
   the board
3. (ADVANCED) Shuffle _Military Deck I_ and place it on the board

### Set up player mats ###

Fill production/population banks, worker pool, and initial units (update science
rating and strength accordingly). Take civil and military tokens according to
your government.

## First turn ##

1. Starting player gets 1 civil action, next gets 2, etc. Take cards from the
   card row
2. [Maintenance](#maintenance)

## Normal Turn ##

The basic turn structure is

1. [Card row](#card-row)
2. [(FULL) War](#full-war)
3. [(SIMPLE) Events](#simple-events)
4. [(ADVANCED) Political action](#advanced-political-action)
6. [Civil/military actions](#civilmilitary-actions)
7. [Maintenance](#maintenance)

### Card Row ###

1. Remove cards based on number of players
2. Shift cards down
3. Deal new cards
4. (ADVANCED) If a civil deck was exhausted, it's the end of that age and the
   previous age becomes obsolete (e.g. the last card from _Civil Deck I_
   obsoletes antiquity). Replace the _Military Deck_ with the one from the next
   age. All players:
   1. Discard obsolete leaders, unfinished wonders, pacts, and cards in hand
   2. (FULL) Aside from the end of antiquity, return 2 yellow tokens _from your
      bank_ to the box

After the starting player's second turn, the remaining cards from _Civil Deck A_
are returned to the box and replaced with _Civil Deck I_.

### (FULL) War ###

Resolve a previously declared war as a normal aggression except:

* You may not use defensive bonuses
* The defender claims the bonus if they win

### (SIMPLE) Events ###

Only if you are the starting player and it is after the second round, reveal the
top _CURRENT EVENTS_ card.

### (ADVANCED) Political Action ###

You may do _one_ of the following:

* Play an event onto the _FUTURE EVENTS_ deck, score culture points equal to its
  age, and reveal the top _CURRENT EVENT_. If that is the last _CURRENT EVENT_,
  shuffle _FUTURE EVENTS_ and move them to _CURRENT EVENTS_, ordering them by
  age
  * To resolve _New Territory_, players bid on the territory by sacrificing
    military units and playing _Colonization Bonuses_. You do not have to
    specify how you will pay unless you win. You must sacrifice at least one
    unit, your total payment may exceed your bid
  * When breaking ties for events (e.g. "the strongest", "the most"), the tie is
    broken in favor of the player that will go first
* Play aggression/war against a player. War is resolved [next round](#full-war)
  1. Offense may sacrifice units to double their strength
  2. Defense may then sacrifice units and/or play defensive bonuses
  3. If offense _exceeds_ the defense strength, they take the bonus from the
     defense (not more than the defense has)
* Propose a (specific) pact to a (specific) player (replacing any existing pact
  you have)
* Dissolve a previous pact

(FULL) Unit sacrifices are not allowed in the last round.

### Civil/military actions ###

Possible civil actions

* Take cards
  * You have a hand limit equal to your maximum number of civil actions
  * You can take at most 1 leader from each age
  * Wonders you take go under construction immediately (limit of 1 under
    construction at a time)
  * It costs 1 extra action to take a wonder for each finished wonder you have
  * You must wait until next turn to play an action you just took
  * You cannot take a technology that you already have (in hand or in play)
* Increase population
* Build/upgrade/destroy buildings
  * Mind your government's urban building limit
* Construct a stage of your wonder
* Play leader/technology/action
  * (ADVANCED) Special technologies with the same illustration replace each
    other
* Declare revolution (takes _ALL_ of your civil actions)

Possible military actions

* Build/upgrade/destroy units
* (ADVANCED) Play tactics (new tactics replace previous ones)
  * Antiquated units reduce effectiveness of some armies
  * (FULL) Each army can have one air force unit, to double its bonus

### Maintenance ###

The next player can start their turn now.

1. (ADVANCED) Fill unmet happiness spaces with unused workers. If you do not
   have enough workers to do so, it's an _UPRISING_. Your turn is over
2. Score science and culture points
3. Produce food for each farm worker
4. Consumption: return food to the supply according to your population bank
   * If you do not have enough food, lose 4 culture points for each food you are
     missing
5. Produce resources for each mine worker
   * (ADVANCED) Optionally return 1 resource to the supply
6. (ADVANCED) Corruption: return resources to the supply according to your
   supply
7. (ADVANCED) Discard military cards down to your maximum number of military
   actions, then draw military cards for each unused military action (at most 3)
   * If the military deck runs out, shuffle the discards from the current age to
     form a new one

## Scoring ##

When the last civil deck has been emptied and every player has had the same
number of turns, the game ends.

(FULL) Except in the full game, where there is one more round.

* (SIMPLE) Each civilization scores bonus culture points:
  * 2 points for each Level 1 technology (including governments)
  * 2 points for each strength
  * 2 points for each happy face
  * 1 culture point for each food and resource produced per round
  * culture points equal to its science rating
* (ADVANCED only) The 4 **Event** cards from _Military Deck III_ take effect
* (FULL) All _Age III_ **Event** cards remaining in _CURRENT_ and _FUTURE
  EVENTS_ take effect

The player with the most culture points wins.
